      Documentation: MineSweeper 
        Description: MineSweeper is a console-based game where the player uncovers squares on a grid, trying to avoid mines (represented by '*'). 
        The game ends if the player uncovers a mine or successfully uncovers all squares without hitting a mine.

        Specifications:
        - The game uses ASCII art for grid representation.
        - The player can choose to reveal a square or place a marker on a potential mine location.
        - If a revealed square has no adjacent mines, neighboring squares are automatically revealed.
        - The game ends if a mine is revealed or all non-mine squares are revealed.
        - The player can choose to play again after winning or losing.
        
        Components:
        1. reset(): Sets up the game by generating a grid with mines and initializing a grid for player's moves. Displays main menu for instructions or immediate play.
        2. placeBomb(b): Places a bomb in a random location on the grid.
        3. updateValues(rn, c, b): Increments adjacent squares' values when a bomb is placed.
        4. zeroProcedure(r, c, k, b): Reveals all adjacent squares when a zero is revealed.
        5. checkZeros(k, b, r, c): Checks for zeros in the grid and reveals adjacent squares accordingly.
        6. marker(r, c, k): Places a marker on the given location.
        7. printBoard(b): Prints the current state of the grid.
        8. choose(b, k, startTime): Allows the player to choose a square or place a marker.
        9. play(b, k, startTime): Main gameplay function, handles player moves, game progression, and end conditions.
        
        Usage:
        - Run reset() to start the game.
        - Follow on-screen instructions to play or view instructions.
        - Choose squares to reveal or place markers to avoid mines.
        - Win by revealing all non-mine squares or lose by revealing a mine.
        - Play again option is available after winning or losing.
        
        Additional Functionality:
