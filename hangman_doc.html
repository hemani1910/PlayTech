        Documentation: Hangman Game

        Description: This Python program implements a simple Hangman game where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word.
         The player has a limited number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art for the hangman stages.
        
        Specifications:
        - Uses a list of words (word_list) for the player to guess from.
        - Randomly selects a word (chosen_word) from the word_list.
        - Displays the length of the word as underscores (display) to represent hidden letters.
        - Allows the player to guess a letter and updates the display accordingly.
        - Tracks the player's remaining lives and ends the game if all lives are lost or the word is guessed correctly.
        - Prints ASCII art for each stage of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
        
        Components:
        1. word_list: List of words for the player to guess.
        2. chosen_word: Randomly selected word from word_list for the current game.
        3. word_length: Length of the chosen_word.
        4. end_of_game: Boolean flag to indicate the end of the game.
        5. lives: Number of lives the player has remaining.
        6. display: List representing the current state of the word, with underscores for hidden letters.
        7. Game Loop:
           - Allows the player to guess a letter.
           - Checks if the guessed letter is in the chosen_word and updates the display.
           - Decreases the player's remaining lives if the guess is incorrect.
           - Ends the game if all lives are lost or the word is guessed correctly.
        8. ASCII Art:
           - Uses ASCII art stored in stages from hangman_art.py to visually represent the hangman stages.
           - Prints the ASCII art corresponding to the current number of lives remaining.
        
        Usage:
        - Run the program to start a new game of Hangman.
        - Guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
        - Use the ASCII art to track your progress and remaining lives.
        - Win the game by guessing the word correctly or lose by running out of lives.
        
        Note: This program provides a basic implementation of the Hangman game. 
        You can expand it by adding more words to the word_list or customizing the ASCII art for a more engaging experience.
