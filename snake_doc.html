        Documentation: Snake Game

        Description: This Python program implements a simple Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. 
        The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.

        Components:
        1. Snake Class:
        - Represents the snake in the game.
        - segments: List of turtle segments making up the snake.
        - head: Reference to the first segment (head) of the snake.
        - Methods:
            - create_snake: Creates the initial segments of the snake.
            - add_segment: Adds a new segment to the snake.
            - extend: Extends the snake by adding a new segment.
            - move: Moves the snake forward by one segment.

        2. Food Class:
        - Represents the food that the snake eats.
        - Inherits from the Turtle class.
        - Methods:
            - refresh: Moves the food to a random position on the screen.

        3. Scoreboard Class:
        - Displays the player's score and game over message.
        - Methods:
            - update_scoreboard: Updates the scoreboard with the current score.
            - game_over: Displays the game over message.
            - increase_score: Increases the player's score.

        4. Main Game Loop:
        - Sets up the game screen and initializes objects (snake, food, scoreboard).
        - Listens for keyboard input to control the snake's movement.
        - Updates the screen and moves the snake in each iteration of the game loop.
        - Checks for collisions with the food, walls, and itself.
        - Ends the game if a collision occurs, displaying the game over message.

        Usage:
        - Run the program to start the Snake game.
        - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.
        - Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score.
        - Avoid running into the walls or the snake itself.
        - The game ends when the snake collides, and the final score is displayed.

        Note: This is a basic implementation of the Snake game. 
        You can customize the game by changing the colors, speed, or adding new features to make it more challenging and enjoyable.
